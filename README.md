# Alcohol-Consumptions-by-Countries-Dashboard

In this project, I have analyzed the Alcohol consumption by countries dataset, an open-source dataset from Kaggle, and build interactive dashboards showing complete covid19 statistics of every country. The dashboard also indicates the alcohol consumption Rank of the country and the top and least alcoholic countries by their geographical location and total alcohol consumed per capita. and in this project, I have used some third-party visuals which display health warnings which makes our dashboard more meaningful.

I have followed a professional approach to build an interactive and impactful dashboard.
